README file for ssh-spawner
================================
Paul H. Hargrove <PHHargrove@lbl.gov>
$Revision: 1.1 $

See vapi-conduit for an example of how to use this code in a conduit.

When using the ssh-spawner, the following apply:

+ usage summary:
    your_app [-v] N[:M] [--] [args ...]
  where N is the number of processes to run, and M is the number of
  nodes/hosts over which the processes will be distributed.  If only
  N is given, then M=N by default.
  If running a UPC or Titanium application, then language-specific
  commands should be used instead.

+ A list of hosts is specified using either the GASNET_SSH_NODEFILE
  or GASNET_SSH_SERVERS environment variables.
  If set, the variable GASNET_SSH_NODEFILE specifies a file with one
  hostname per line.  Blank lines and comment lines (using '#') are
  ignored.
  If set, the variable GASNET_SSH_SERVERS itself contains a list of
  hostnames, delimited by commas or whitespace.
  If both are set, GASNET_SSH_NODEFILE takes precedence.
  Note that if starting a job via upcrun or tirun, these varaibles
  may be set for you from other sources.

+ The environment variable GASNET_SSH_CMD can be set to specify a
  specific remote shell (perhaps rsh).  The default is "ssh", and
  a search of $PATH resolves the full path.

+ The environment variable GASNET_SSH_OPTIONS can be set to
  specify options that will preceed the hostname in the commands
  used to spawn jobs.  One example, for OpenSsh, would be
    GASNET_SSH_OPTIONS="-o 'StrictHostKeyChecking no'"

+ For the following, the term "compute node"  means one of the hosts
  given by GASNET_SSH_NODEFILE or GASNET_SSH_SERVERS, which will run
  an application process.  The term "master node" means the node from
  which the job was spawned.  The master node may or may not be one
  of the compute nodes.

+ The ssh (or rsh) at your site must be configured to allow logins
  from the master node to compute nodes, and among the compute nodes.
  These must be achived without interaction (such as entering a
  password or accepting new hostkeys).

+ Any firewall or port filtering must allow the ssh/rsh connections
  described above, plus TCP connections on untrusted port (those
  with numners over 1024) from a compute node to the master node and
  and among compute nodes.

+ Resolution for all given hostnames must be possible from both the
  master node and the compute nodes.
