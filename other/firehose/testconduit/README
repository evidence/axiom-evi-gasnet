This directory contains a testconduit, which is basically a stripped down
version of a GASNet conduit with just enough support for conduit functionality
used in firehose.

It is not meant to be built as part of GASNet in any and is simply used as a
debug mechanism for firehose-uni and firehose-smp variants.
