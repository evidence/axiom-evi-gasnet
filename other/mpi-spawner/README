README file for mpi-spawner
================================
Paul H. Hargrove <PHHargrove@lbl.gov>

See ibv-conduit for an example of how to use this code in a conduit.

When using the mpi-spawner, the following apply:

+ usage summary:
    mpirun -np N your_app [args ...]
  where N is the number of processes to run.
  If running a UPC or Titanium application, then language-specific
  commands should be used instead.

+ In order to use this spawner, a working MPI must be installed
  and configured on your system.  See mpi-conduit/README for
  information on configuring GASNet for a particular MPI.  Note that
  you must compile mpi-conduit as well (even if you never plan to use
  it).

+ Since that MPI is only used in gasnet_init(), gasnet_attach() and
  gasnet_exit() and not for any GASNet communications.  Therefore
  it is acceptable to use a TCP/IP based MPI such as MPICH or LAM/MPI.

Recognized Environment Variables:

* GASNET_MPI_THREAD - can be set to one of the values:
    "SINGLE", "FUNNELED", "SERIALIZED" or "MULTIPLE" 
  to request the MPI library be initialized with a specific threading support
  level. The default value depends on the GASNET_{SEQ,PAR} mode and the conduit.
  + SINGLE - sufficient for mpi-spawner itself. This MPI thread mode is 
    only guaranteed to work correctly in a strictly single-threaded process 
    (ie no threads anywhere in the system). 
  + FUNNELED - Other threads exist in the process, but never call MPI or GASNet.
  + SERIALIZED - GASNET_PAR or GASNET_PARSYNC mode, where multiple client threads may
    call GASNet. Also required if the conduit spawns internal AM progress threads.
  + MULTIPLE - Multi-threaded GASNet+MPI process that makes direct calls to MPI.
  See MPI documentation for detailed explanation of the threading levels.
