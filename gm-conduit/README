README file for gm-conduit
================================
Christian Bell <csbell@cs.berkeley.edu>

Core files:
gasnet_core.c		Main core functions
gasnet_core.h		Function prototypes for core
gasnet_core_fwd.h
gasnet_core_help.h
gasnet_core_internal.h
gasnet_core_firehose.c	Client-independent implementation of the firehose
			dynamic memory registration algorithm over AM
gasnet_core_misc.c	Misc. core functions send/callbacks/AM registration
gasnet_core_receive.c	GM receive/polling functions and AM reception

Extended files:
gasnet_extended.c		Main extended functions, which remain
				independent of the dynamic memory registration
				algorithm (mostly functions to sync and access
				regions).
gasnet_extended_internal.h
gasnet_extended_op.c		Op management, important from extended-ref
gasnet_extended_ref.c		Extended ref operations, used as fallbacks in
				both turkey and firehose algorithms
gasnet_extended.h		Function prototypes for extended
gasnet_extended_firehose.c	Extended firehose provides all put/get
				functions for firehose algorithm and supplies
				AM reply handlers to plug into
				gasnet_core_firehose.c 
gasnet_extended_turkey.c	Extended turkey provides all put/get functions
				for the turkey sandwich algorithms and supplies
				AM reply handlers to plug into 
				gasnet_core_turkey.c
				(not implemented or committed yet).

Tags:
	GM_RENDEZVOUS:	gm-conduit specific tag, which uses a snapshot from Oct
			2002 and implements rendezvous instead of firehose.
			This was needed in a firehose paper showing performance
			characteristics and comparing the algorithm to a
			rendezvous approach.
			
			From a current gasnet checkout, in gm-conduit
			directory, run
			% cvs up -PAd -r GM_RENDEZVOUS
			Note that some minor code changes might be required in
			order to have this version of the gm-conduit compile.
