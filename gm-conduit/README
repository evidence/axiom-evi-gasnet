Core files:
gasnet_core.c		Main core functions
gasnet_core.h		Function prototypes for core
gasnet_core_fwd.h
gasnet_core_help.h
gasnet_core_internal.h
gasnet_core_firehose.c	Client-independent implementation of the firehose
			dynamic memory registration algorithm over AM
gasnet_core_turkey.c	Implementation of the turkey sandwich algorithm, which
			is mainly geared to optimising RDMA operations for UPC
			clients.
gasnet_core_misc.c	Misc. core functions send/callbacks/AM registration
gasnet_core_receive.c	GM receive/polling functions and AM reception

Extended files:
gasnet_extended.c		Main extended functions, which remain
				independent of the dynamic memory registration
				algorithm (mostly functions to sync and access
				regions).
gasnet_extended_internal.h
gasnet_extended_op.c		Op management, important from extended-ref
gasnet_extended_ref.c		Extended ref operations, used as fallbacks in
				both turkey and firehose algorithms
gasnet_extended.h		Function prototypes for extended
gasnet_extended_firehose.c	Extended firehose provides all put/get
				functions for firehose algorithm and supplies
				AM reply handlers to plug into
				gasnet_core_firehose.c 
gasnet_extended_turkey.c	Extended turkey provides all put/get functions
				for the turkey sandwich algorithms and supplies
				AM reply handlers to plug into
				gasnet_core_turkey.c
