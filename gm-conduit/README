README file for gm-conduit
================================
Christian Bell <csbell@cs.berkeley.edu>

This first version of the GM conduit implements the full GASNet.  Here are some
of the highlights and quirks. .

 ** Bootstrapping
    Bootstrapping has always been a problem over Myrinet.  Myricom releases a
    better better job spawner at every MPICH release but is not quite there
    yet.  As of MPICH 1.2.4.x, MPICH/GM uses a perl script spawner to
    distribute GM port usage information at initialization.  This script has
    been included and edited here in order to work with the GM conduit.
    However, it is also possible to bootstrap using a ~/.gmpi/conf file in
    user's home directories (this use to be the bootstrap method before MPICH
    1.2.4.x was released).  To summarize, the following bootstrap methods are
    attempted. .

    1. If the included gasnetrun.pl script is used, GM port information is
       exchanged through the spawner script.
    2. If the script isn't used, port information is read from
       $HOME/.gmpi/conf.  The syntax of the file is the following:
       2
       host001 2
       host002 4
       Where the first line contains the number of processors and each other
       line contains the host and its GM port number.
       This method of bootstrapping is useful for sites which run GM port
       daemons and for debugging.

 ** Memory registration
    The GM conduit presents a new algorithm for dealing with pinning of large
    memory spaces.  See paper at http://upc.lbl.gov/publications/ for
    Bell, Bonachea. "A New DMA Registration Strategy for Pinning-Based High Performance
    Networks", Workshop on Communication Architecture for Clusters (CAC'03),
    2003.
    Memory pinning is controlled through two parameters, M and MAXVICTIM.  The
    sum of both of these parameters represents the total amount of memory that
    can be pinned locally. M is the amount put aside to satisfy remote requests
    for pinned memory while MAXVICTIM is the amount to satisfy locally
    initiated one-sided operations.  These parameters are controlled at runtime
    using two environment variables,
       GASNETGM_FIREHOSE_M,
       GASNETGM_FIREHOSE_MAXVICTIM.
    Although a site administrator can tune these values to better match the
    cluster's needs, the bootstrapping mechanism manages to find a sensible
    default.  If the gasnetrun script is used, the '--fh-M' and
    '--fh-maxvictim' switches allow to set these values.

 ** File list
    Core files:
    gasnet_core.c		Main core functions
    gasnet_core.h		Function prototypes for core
    gasnet_core_fwd.h
    gasnet_core_help.h
    gasnet_core_internal.h
    gasnet_core_firehose.c	Client-independent implementation of the
				firehose dynamic memory registration algorithm
				over AM
    gasnet_core_misc.c		Misc. core functions send/callbacks/AM
    gasnet_core_receive.c	GM receive/polling functions and AM reception
    
    Extended files:
    gasnet_extended.c		Main extended functions, which remain
    				independent of the dynamic memory registration
    				algorithm (mostly functions to sync and access
    				regions).
    gasnet_extended_internal.h
    gasnet_extended_op.c	Op management, important from extended-ref
    gasnet_extended_ref.c	Extended ref operations, used as fallbacks in
    				both turkey and firehose algorithms
    gasnet_extended.h		Function prototypes for extended
    gasnet_extended_firehose.c	Extended firehose provides all put/get
    				functions for firehose algorithm and supplies
    				AM reply handlers to plug into
    				gasnet_core_firehose.c 
    
 ** Development CVS tags/branches
	GM_RENDEZVOUS:	gm-conduit specific tag, which uses a snapshot from Oct
			2002 and implements rendezvous instead of firehose.
			This was needed in a firehose paper showing performance
			characteristics and comparing the algorithm to a
			rendezvous approach.
			
			From a current gasnet checkout, in gm-conduit
			directory, run
			% cvs up -PAd -r GM_RENDEZVOUS
			Note that some minor code changes might be required in
			order to have this version of the gm-conduit compile.
