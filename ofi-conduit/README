User Information:
----------------
This is the README for ofi-conduit.

OpenFabrics Interfaces (OFI) is a framework focused on exporting fabric
communication services to applications. OFI is best described as a collection
of libraries and applications used to export fabric services. 

See more details at: http://ofiwg.github.io/libfabric/

Where this conduit runs:
-----------------------

The GASNet OFI conduit can run on any OFI provider that supports its requirements. At this
point in time, it is known to work on the Sockets provider, Intel Truescale provider (psm),
and Intel Omni-Path provider (psm2).  The fi_info command installed with libfabric can be 
used to query the available OFI providers.

The OFI conduit can be considered as a tech-preview for next generation fabrics. We are
in the process of tuning its performance on Intel Omni-Path fabric. If you are looking to
obtain the best performance on Intel Omni-Path fabric, please continue to use the PSM
conduit until we complete our performance optimizations. 

Users with InfiniBand hardware should use the GASNet ibv-conduit, as the verbs OFI provider
does not yet implement all the capabilities needed by ofi-conduit.

Users with Ethernet hardware are encouraged to consider the GASNet udp-conduit as an alternative
to ofi-conduit with the sockets provider, as the former may provide more favorable performance.

Building ofi-conduit
--------------------

Libfabric is a core component of OFI. To use ofi-conduit, the user firsts needs to 
locate or build an install of libfabric. The source code of libfabric can be found at:

   https://github.com/ofiwg/libfabric

To build GASNet with ofi-conduit enabled:
./configure --prefix=[Build Path] --enable-ofi --with-ofihome=[custom libfabric install directory]

To set job launcher, add --with-ofispawner=[ssh or mpi or pmi].
When using PMI as job launcher, the user can further add
--with-spawnerroot=[custom job launcher directory] 
to specify which job launcher to use.

Recognized environment variables:
---------------------------------

* GASNET_OFI_SPAWNER - set to "mpi", "ssh" or "pmi" to override the value set at
  configuration time. The gasnetrun_ofi -spawner option overrides the
  environment variable.

* GASNET_QUIET - set to 1 to silence the startup warning indicating
  the provider in use may deliver suboptimal performance.

* FI_PROVIDER - set to a provider name to override the default OFI provider selection

* All the environment variables provided by libfabric (see `fi_info -e`)

* The environment variables described in the "Non-bulk, Non-blocking Put Functions" 
  section of this file.

* All the standard GASNet environment variables (see top-level README)


Non-bulk, Non-blocking Put Functions
------------------------------------
GASNet requires the source buffer used in the gasnet_put_{nb,nbi} functions to be able to be reused as
soon as the function returns. The ofi-conduit implements this by a hybrid approach that uses
the FI_INJECT flag, bounce buffers, and blocking operations.

* If the nbytes parameter is less than or equal to the chosen provider's inject_size (see the 
  fi_endpoint(3) man page), the FI_INJECT flag will be used.
* If the nbytes parameter is greater than the inject size but less than or equal to a user specifiable
  threshold (default is 4 times the bounce buffer size) then bounce buffers will be used.
* If the nbytes parameter is greater than the threshold, the operation will be implemented as a 
  fully-blocking operation.

The following GASNet statistics counters show the number of times each of these code paths are enterred:
NB_PUT_INJECT, NB_PUT_BOUNCE, NB_PUT_BLOCK.

The following environment variables may be used to tune this behavior:
* GASNET_OFI_BBUF_SIZE - The size of each bounce buffer. Default is GASNET_PAGESIZE.
* GASNET_OFI_NUM_BBUFS - The number of bounce buffers to be allocated at initialization. Default: 64
* GASNET_OFI_BBUF_THRESHOLD - Payload sizes of (GASNET_OFI_BBUF_THRESHOLD + 1) will be transferred
  as a blocking operation. This is useful for when the overheads of bounce buffering become too great.
  Default: (4 * GASNET_OFI_BBUF_SIZE).
* The following condition must hold: GASNET_OFI_NUM_BBUFS >= GASNET_OFI_BBUF_THRESHOLD/GASNET_OFI_BBUF_SIZE
* These defaults are chosen to optimize for a 256K L2 cache, assuming 4K pages. It is recommended to 
  modify these variables so that GASNET_PAGESIZE * GASNET_OFI_NUM_BBUFS == L2-cache-size. However,
  these tuning parameters only apply to gasnet_put_{nb,nbi}(). They do not apply to get functions, blocking
  functions, or bulk put functions.



Known problems:
---------------

* See the Berkeley UPC Bugzilla server for details on known bugs.


Future work:
------------

The OFI community is working on increasing the number of providers that can support GASNet.
