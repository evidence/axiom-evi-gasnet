GASNet ofi-conduit documentation
$Revision: 1.0 $

User Information:
----------------
This is the README for ofi-conduit.

OpenFabrics Interfaces (OFI) is a framework focused on exporting fabric
communication services to applications. OFI is best described as a collection
of libraries and applications used to export fabric services. 

See more details at: http://ofiwg.github.io/libfabric/

@ Section: Where this conduit runs @

### Explain the hardware/systems where your conduit runs. Be sure to use
### high-level marketing names that should be understandable to any end-user. 
### Include any software/driver/firmware/hw requirements or limitations.
### Mention any situation where a different GASNet conduit should be preferred.

@ Section: Building @

Libfabric is a core component of OFI. To use ofi-conduit, the user needs first
install libfabric. The source code of libfabric can be found at:
https://github.com/ofiwg/libfabric

To build GASNet with ofi-conduit enabled:
./configure --prefix=[Build Path] --enable-ofi --with-ofihome=[custom libfabric install directory]

To set job launcher, add --with-ofispawner=[ssh or mpi or pmi].
When using PMI as job launcher, the user can further add
--with-spawnerroot=[custom job launcher directory] 
to specify which job launcher to use.

At runtime the environment variable GASNET_OFI_SPAWNER (set to "mpi" or "ssh")
can override the value set at configuration time, but the command line option
will override the environment variable.

Where this conduit runs:
-----------------------

The GASNet OFI conduit can run on any OFI provider that supports its requirements. At this
point in time, it is known to work on the Sockets provider, Intel Truescale provider (psm),
and Intel Omni-Path provider (psm2).

The OFI conduit can be considered as a tech-preview for next generation fabrics. We are
in the process of tuning its performance on Intel Omni-Path fabric. If you are looking to
obtain the best performance on Intel Omni-Path fabric, please continue to use the PSM
conduit until we complete our performance optimizations.


Future work:
------------

The OFI community is working on increasing the number of providers that can support GASNet.
