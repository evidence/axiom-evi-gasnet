README file for template-conduit
================================
Dan Bonachea <bonachea@cs.berkeley.edu>

This file contains a template to help implementors get started in implementing a
GASNet conduit. It is not a functioning conduit - merely a "skeleton" with most
of the infrastructure in place so one can start filling in code specific to the
conduit network.

To use the template:

* Choose a conduit name - pick something relatively short and descriptive

* Copy the template-conduit directory to conduitname-conduit

* Do a search-and-replace on the files for the following patterns:
  <CONDUITNAME> => your conduit name, all in upper-case
  <conduitname> => your conduit name, all in lower-case
  (be sure not to insert any extraneous space characters around the names)

* Rename the following files: (replace "template" with your lower-case conduit name)
    template-par.mak.in
    template-parsync.mak.in
    template-seq.mak.in

* Add your new directory to the top-level Makefile and any necessary
configuration checks to the configure.in script. You should create an
AM_CONDITIONAL() called USE_<CONDUITNAME>_CONDUIT and use it to control the
building of your conduit and any associated libraries in other/.

* Start filling in code specific to your conduit
  Several places in the template are marked with ### to indicate a place where
  you must fill in conduit-specific values or code

The template is already setup to use the reference implementation of the
extended API, so you're recommended to start by implementing the core API, then
once that's done you can optionally choose to tune further by dropping in a
conduit-specific implementation of the extended API.

Please try not to make trivial or non-meaningful changes to the code or
makefile framework included in template-conduit (e.g. re-indenting lines, 
moving code into different files, renaming existing identifiers, etc.)
as this makes it more difficult to patch your conduit if a bug is 
discovered in template-conduit or a GASNet-wide change is required.
