GASNet pami-conduit documentation

$Revision: 1.3 $

User Information:
-----------------

This is a prelinary BETA release of support for IBM PAMI.
The implementation is "complete" (in terms of functionality) and is
beleieved to be stable.  However, it has not yet been tuned to take
advantage of many PAMI features which could provide faster
implemenations of the Extended (RDMA) interfaces, Barriers, and the
GASNet collectives.

Recognized environment variables:
---------------------------------

* All the standard GASNet environment variables (see top-level README)

* GASNET_NETWORK_DEPTH - depth of AM Request queues (default 1024)
  This integer parameter sets the limit on the number of outstanding
  Active Message Requests, where outstanding is defined in terms of
  local completion of the network send.
  Too-small values may reduce performance of AM-intensive applications.
  Too-large values may result in excessive buffering requirements in
  AM-intensive applications which can both reduce performance and can
  result in excessive memory use.
  Applications not sending "floods" of AMs will be be insensitve to
  the value of this parameter.
  [BUT, keep in mind that current reference implementation of the
   extended API implements all Put and Get operations over AMs.]

* GASNET_AMPOLL_MAX - limit on work done in AMPoll (default 16)
  This integer parameter sets the maxumum number of PAMI operations
  to be retired by a call to gasnet_AMPoll().

Optional compile-time settings:
------------------------------

* The following compile-time settings from extended-ref
  (see the extended-ref README)

 + GASNETI_THREADINFO_OPT - optimize thread discovery using hidden local variable

 + GASNETI_LAZY_BEGINFUNCTION - postpone thread discovery to first use

 + GASNETE_SCATTER_EOPS_ACROSS_CACHELINES(1/0) - scatter newly allocated eops
    across cache lines to reduce false sharing

Known problems:
---------------

* See the Berkeley UPC Bugzilla server for details on known bugs.

Future work:
------------

The following are planned work items for pami-conduit:

* Register the GASNet segment and use PAMI_Rput() and PAMI_Rget().

* Register bounce buffers used for AM headers and payloads and apply
  the appropriate "use_rdma" hints.

* Use multiple PAMI contexts/endpoints.  At a minimum it would be desirable
  to separate the AM and RDMA for independent progress.  Use of multiple
  endpoints when using pthreads is also worth some implementation effort.
  A separate context used for the exit coordination would prevent deadlock
  when exiting from an AM handler.

* Explore use of PAMI's "remote_async_progress" hint.

* Explore use of bounce buffers to avoid blocking for local completion
  of non-blocking/non-bulk Puts.

* Explore use of conduit-level flow control for AMs, though it is not yet
  certain that this is needed as it was with dcmf-conduit.

* Implement GASNet's named split-phase barrier in terms of PAMI's
  ALLREDUCE collective.

* Implement GASNet's collectives in terms of PAMI's collectives.

* Improve exit handling to raise SIGQUIT for non-collective exits.

* For sufficiently small payloads, AMRequestLong could use a bounce buffer
  to avoid stalling for local completion.

==============================================================================

Design Overview:
----------------

* Core API:
  + GASNet's AMs are implemented in terms of PAMI's AMs, and execute
    handlers directly from the PAMI callbacks.
    - Short AMs use PAMI_Send_immediate() due to their length.
    - Medium and Long AMs use PAMI_Send().
    - Medium AMs their payload to a bounce buffer to avoid stalling
      for local completion.
    - Long Request AMs DO block for local completion.
    - s LongAsync Request AMs DO NOE block for local completion.
    - Long Replies AMs copying their payload to a bounce buffer, like
      a Medium AM, since our running of AM handlers from PAMI's
      callbacks precludes blocking for local completion.
  + GASNet's default AM-based barrier implementations are used.
  + GASNet's exit handling is done using an PAMI "all reduce" operation
    and a timeout to determine the MAX() of the exit codes, and whether
    the exit is collective.  For non-collective exits, the conduit is
    currently calling exit(1) and using the fact that IBM's software
    will take care of aborting the job.  However this does NOT get the
    desired behavior of raising SIGQUIT on the non-exiting nodes.
  + PSHM is supported through the default mechanisms

* Extended API:
  + The segment is allocated using mmap() via the default mechanisms.
  + The segment is NOT YET pinned/registered.
  + All Extended API operations are performed using PAMI_Put and _Get,
    with the advantage that GASNET_SEGMENT_EVERYTHING "just works".
  + The blocking operations block for remote completion, of course.
  + The non-blocking NON-BULK Put operations will stall for the required
    local completion, but don't need to stall for remote completion.
    There is not currently any use of bounce buffers for these Puts.
