User Information:

Recognized environment variables:
---------------------------------

* All the standard GASNet environment variables (see top-level README)

* GASNET_NETWORK_DEPTH - depth of AM Request queues (default 1024)
  This integer parameter sets the limit on the number of outstanding
  Active Message Requests, where outstanding is defined in terms of
  local completion of the network send.
  Too-small values may reduce performance of AM-intensive applications.
  Too-large values may result in excessive buffering requirements in
  AM-intensive applications which can both reduce performance and can
  result in excessive memory use.
  Applications not sending "floods" of AMs will be be insensitve to
  the value of this parameter.
  [BUT, keep in mind that current reference implementation of the
   extended API implements all Put and Get operations over AMs.]

* GASNET_AMPOLL_MAX - limit on work done in AMPoll (default 16)
  This integer parameter sets the maxumum number of PAMI operations
  to be retired by a call to gasnet_AMPoll().

Optional compile-time settings:
------------------------------

* All the compile-time settings from extended-ref (see the extended-ref README)

Known problems:
---------------

* See the Berkeley UPC Bugzilla server for details on known bugs.
