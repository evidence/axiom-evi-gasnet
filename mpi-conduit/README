GASNet mpi-conduit documentation

User Information:
-----------------

Recognized environment variables:
---------------------------------

* All the standard GASNet environment variables (see top-level README)

* GASNET_NETWORKDEPTH - depth of network buffers to allocate

Configuration-time variables:
---------------------------------

In order to compile mpi-conduit, and subsequently use it, GASNet must
know how to invoke your mpicc and mpirun (or equivalents).  GASNet's
configure script use some sensible defaults, but these may not work
on all platforms.  In particular, if you have set CC to a non-default
C compiler, you will likely need to set mpicc as well.  Here are
the relevant variables:

MPI_CC		the program to use as the compiler and linker
MPI_CFLAGS	options passed to MPI_CC when used as a compiler
MPI_LIBS	options passed to MPI_CC when used as a linker
MPIRUN_CMD	template for invoking mpirun, or equivalent

GASNet's configure script will test the MPI_CC, MPI_CFLAGS and
MPI_LIBS variable by trying approximately the following:

	$MPI_CC $MPI_CFLAGS -c foo.c
	$MPI_CC $MPI_LIBS -o foo foo.o

GASNet's configure script does not attempt to run MPIRUN_CMD.
MPIRUN_CMD is a template which tells the gasnetrun_mpi
script how to invoke your mpirun.  The template should include
the following strings for variable substitution at run time:

"%N"	The number of MPI processes requested
"%P"	The GASNet program to run
"%A"	The arguments to the GASNet program
"%C"	Alias for "%P %A"

The default is "mpirun -np %N %C".  You may need a full path to
mpirun if the correct version is not in your PATH.  This template
is also the mechanism to add extra arguments - for instance:
  MPIRUN_CMD='mpirun -np %N -hostfile my_hosts_file %C'

Optional compile-time settings:
------------------------------

* All the compile-time settings from extended-ref (see the extended-ref README)

Known problems:
---------------

* Proper operation of GASNet and its client often depends on environment
variables passed to all the processes.  Unfortunately, there is no uniform way
to achieve this across different implementations of mpirun.  The gasnetrun_mpi
script tries many different things and is known to work correctly for LAM/MPI
and for MPICH and most of its derivatives (including MPICH-NT, MVICH and
MVAPICH).  For assistance with any particular MPI implementation, search the
Berkeley UPC Bugzilla server and open a new bug (registration required) if
you cannot find information on your MPI.

* See the Berkeley UPC Bugzilla server for details on other known bugs.

Design Overview:
----------------

The core API implementation is a very thin wrapper around the AMMPI
implementation by Dan Bonachea. See documentation in the other/ammpi directory
or the AMMPI webpage (http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bonachea/ammpi) for details.

The mpi-conduit directly uses the extended-ref implementation for the extended
API - see the extended-ref directory for details.
