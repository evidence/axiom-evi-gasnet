GASNet mxm-conduit documentation
============================================

User Information:
-----------------

### Provide a high-level overview of your conduit

Where this conduit runs:
-----------------------

### Explain the hardware/systems where your conduit runs. Be sure to use
### high-level marketing names that should be understandable to any end-user. 
### Include any software/driver/firmware/hw requirements or limitations.
### Mention any situation where a different GASNet conduit should be preferred.

Recognized environment variables:
---------------------------------

* All the standard GASNet environment variables (see top-level README)

Optional compile-time settings:
------------------------------

* All the compile-time settings from extended-ref (see the extended-ref README)

Known problems:
---------------

* See the Berkeley UPC Bugzilla server for details on known bugs.

Future work:

Header Files
------------

    <gasnet_core_fwd.h>
        Definitions of basic constants and types used by the core API and
        included early in the gasnet.h file (gasnet.h provides some default
        values for various constants and types that can be overridden here).

    <gasnet_core.h>
        Provides the public interface for the GASNet core API (function
        prototypes and/or inline functions for implementing the core API).

    <gasnet_core_help.h>
        This is the core's entry point to provide access to private symbols
        which might be required by the core header (e.g.: node's node id,
        number of nodes in job), but which should not really be publicly
        visible to client code (i.e. not part of GASNet API).

    <gasnet_extended.h>
        Provides the public interface for the GASNet extended API

    <gasnet_core_internal.h>
        This file is NOT included by gasnet.h (and therefore not visible to
        client code) and are exclusively for use in building the conduit
        libraries.
        <gasnet_internal.h> is the conduit-independent version of this file
        at the top level.
        Internal GASNet implementation should include <gasnet_internal.h>
        instead of <gasnet.h>.
