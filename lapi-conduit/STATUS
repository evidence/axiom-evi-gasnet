Initial checkin of lapi conduit.

Complete:
========
* Initial working implementation of LAPI conduit.

* Works with GASNET_SEGMENT_LARGE

* Works with GASNET_PAR
   - known issue with shared buffer for lapi error messages.

  (Issues with GASNET_SEQ and GASNET_PARSYNC in upper gasnet
   layer on conduits that execute handlers in seperate, conduit
   owned threads.  Can be concurrent with user threads executing
   client code.)

* optimizations for AM
   - uhdr buffer pool to recude calls to malloc/free
   - Execution of REPLY handler in LAPI header handler, when possible.
   - Pack medium/large data into uhdr

* Loopback working

ToDo - core
===========
* GASNET_SEGMENT_EVERYTHING - see Elan code.

* What to do about GASNET_SEGMENT_FAST?

* Implement the extended API directly over LAPI.
