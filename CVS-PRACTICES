Here are the development practices that GASNet developers are expected to follow:

* All developers doing commits must be on the upc-devel@lbl.gov email list,
  which receives gasnet checkin messages.

* You must include an explanatory log message for any change. It should describe
  the high-level of what you did, and why you did it (e.g. to solve a particular
  bug, etc). Generally larger changes deserve more detailed log messages -
  remember the idea is to keep other developers apprised of changes you've made
  that could affect their work somehow.

* You should only commit working code - do NOT check in untested or flagrantly
  broken code that could affect system stability. The idea is to ensure the main
  trunk of the repository is mostly-working at all times, so try to make sure
  your commits leave the repository in at least as working a state as you found
  it. I understand that it may not be practical to test a given change on all
  platforms, but you should at least test it throughly on your development
  platform, and any other platforms that you have reason to believe may be
  affected (this is especially true for configure scripts and Makefiles). If you
  wish to checkin intermediate or untested versions of your code, please do so
  on a private branch (see http://www.cvshome.org/docs/manual/cvs_5.html#SEC56).

Once the bug tracking system is up and running, checkin messages should
reference any particular bug ID's that they address.
