GASNet sci-conduit documentation

User Information:
-----------------
The top makefile will look for the available libraries and includes in the /opt/DIS
directory. If they are not there, please configure GASNet with --with-sci-includes 
and --with-sci-libs. Here is what a configure might look like:

./configure --enable-sci --enable-segment-fast --with-sci-includes="-I/opt/DIS/include -I/opt/DIS/lib/api" --with-sci-libs=/opt/DIS/lib/api/libsisci.a

Only segment-fast is supported in this release. To use segments of larger than 1MB,
the kernel must be patched with the BigPhysArea patch (sorry, this is a problem with the Dolphin
driver and Linux, we are working to change this). The latest Dolphin driver (2.4) supports 
segment sizes of upto 4MB on some systems, and subsequent releases promise to be able to 
handle sizes on the order of 512MB-1GB.

Dolphin SISCI has no job management routine that we could find. To execute any 
program compiled agaist this library you must use the 'start' script found in the 
sci-conduit directory. This may be seen as the "gasnetrun_sci" script under the contrib 
directory. It is portable (written for the bourne shell), so you can copy it to your program's 
working directory and use it there if needed. Run it without any options to see a help menu.
Basically, the format is: gasnetrun_sci -np [#num_nodes] [-jobs [#machine_file]] <program_name and args>
It needs one of two files, either the jobs file (used with the -jobs flag) or the 
default machines.sci file. Both of these files have the same format of:

#machine-name #sci-id-number

for example:

#>cat jobs.sci
kappa-1	4
kappa-2	8
kappa-3	12
kappa-9 132

and so forth. No comments are allowed in this file as of now (that can be 
changed later if it seems to be needed). In both cases, if the number of UPC threads
(designated by -np #) exceeds the number of machines in the file provided, only 
1 thread will be spawned on each of the machines in the file. The nature of memory 
mapping in SCI makes it difficult to create more than 1 GASNet thread on any machine. 
Therefore GASNet cannot be spawned multiple times on any given machine, one of them 
will not succeed (possibly both if they get intertwined).

As of now, only adapter 0 is supported, that will change in a future revision to 
look for the first available adapter.

Recognized environment variables:
---------------------------------

* All the standard GASNet environment variables (see top-level README)

Optional compile-time settings:
------------------------------

* All the compile-time settings from extended-ref (see the extended-ref README)

Known problems:
---------------

* See the Berkeley UPC Bugzilla server for details on known bugs.

Future work:
------------

Lots. Currently, only the core API is implemented. This uses the reference API 
to implement the extended API. This shows decent performance for put operations, 
but get operations are terrible.

Also, support is being planned for segment-large and segment-everything using the 
gasnet-provided firehose infrastructure.
