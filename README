README file for GASNet
by: Dan Bonachea <bonachea@cs.berkeley.edu>

This is a combination user manual and design document for GASNet. Anyone
planning on using, modifying or adding to the GASNet code base should read this
file. 

Building and Installing GASNet
==============================
Here are the steps to build GASNet:

* ./Bootstrap  
  Runs the autoconf tools to build a configure script (this can be done on any
system and may already have been done for you)

* ./configure (options)
  Generate the Makefiles tailored to your system, creating a build tree in the
current working directory.  You can run configure from a different directory to
place your build files somewhere other than inside the source tree (a nice
option when maintaining several build trees on the same source tree). 
  Some of the useful configure options:
    --help - display all available configure options
    --prefix=/install/path - set the directory where GASNet will be installed
    --enable-debug - build GASNet in a debugging mode. This turns on C-level
debugger options and also enables extensive error checking in the MPI conduit,
which is useful for debugging GASNet clients (but should not be used for
performance testing). 
  Configure will detect various interesting features about your system and
compilers, including which GASNet conduits are supported.

* gmake 
  Build the GASNet libraries. You can also do 'gmake tests' to build various
test programs. 

* gmake install
  Install GASNet to the directory chosen at configure time. This will create an
include directory with a sub-directory for each supported conduit, and a lib
directory containing a library file for each supported conduit, as well as any
supporting libraries.

Basic Usage Information
=================
See the README for each GASNet core implementations for specific usage
information, but generally client programs should include compiler flags like
this (for a single-threaded client):

 -I/install/path/include -I/install/path/include/c-conduitname -DGASNET_SEQ
 -L/install/path/lib -lgasnet-conduitname-seq

GASNet Design Information
=========================

See the GASNet specification for information about the GASNet API. A copy is
included with this archive in docs/, and the definitive version is located on
the GASNet webpage here:

  http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bonachea/upc

The GASNet API is a two-level interface consisting of the lower-level "core API"
and the upper-level "extended API". All of the functions in the extended API can
be implemented using the core API, but some implementations may choose to
implement them directly for performance reasons. We use the term "conduit" to
refer to any complete implementation of the GASNet API (both layers), which
targets a specific network device or lower-level networking layer. A conduit
is comprised of any required headers, source files and supporting libraries
necessary to provide the functionality of the GASNet API to GASNet clients. Some
conduits may be monolithic - implementing the entire GASNet API directly on the
lower-level network system, and others may be layered - directly implementing
just the GASNet core API and borrowing a reference implementation of the
extended API which is written using the core primitives.

This distribution provides several conduits for different networks that are
packaged together for convenience because they share some code and general
infrastructure. However, each conduit is logically a stand-alone implementation
of the GASNet API. Note there may eventually be other GASNet conduits (e.g.
provided by vendors) which need not be included as part of this distribution -
all that's required of a conduit is that it implements the standardized GASNet API.

System Organization
===================

The directory tree for this distribution looks something like this:

top-level/
 \__ config-aux/
 \__ tests/
 \__ docs/
 \__ extended-ref/
 \__ {conduitname1}-conduit/
 \__ {conduitname2}-conduit/
 \__ template-conduit/
 \__ other/

* top-level: contains the GASNet configuration scripts and master Makefile and
GASNet headers.

  When making changes to GASNet (esp the configure script), please remember that
GASNet is not only a communication system for UPC, but also a self-contained
product used as the communication system for other languages (like Titanium) so
the configuration scripts, header files, etc. should not rely on anything from
outside directories not included in this distribution (other than basic system
headers and lower-level networking libraries).

* top-level header file: The GASNet master header file (gasnet.h) #includes
several files which must be provided by each conduit:

<gasnet.h> includes the following files:
   <gasnet_config.h> Created by the configure script, this header helps in
		     customizing gasnet for site-specific and platform-specific
		     information.
   <gasnet_basic.h>  Defines various basic and optimizing compiler macros,
                     platform-independent integer types and c++ binding macros.
   <gasnet_core_fwd.h> definitions of basic constants and types used by the
		       core API and included early in the gasnet.h file
		       (gasnet.h provides some default values for various
		       constants and types that can be overridden here)
   <gasnet_extended_fwd.h>  Allows a specific extended implementation to
			    override the default gasnet types such as handles
			    and threadinfo.
   <gasnet_core.h> Includes the public interface for the desired GASNet core
		   (function prototypes and/or inline functions for
		   implementing the core API).
      .. <gasnet_core_help.h> This is the core's entry point to provide access
			      to symbols which might be used in the core, or
			      client code (ie: node's node id, number of nodes
			      in job).
      .. <gasnet_help.h> Extended and core API platform independant helpers.
   <gasnet_extended.h> Includes the public interface for the desired GASNet
                       extended API
      .. <gasnet_extended_help.h> Extended API's entry point to define symbols
				  used by the extended API and the client code
				  (segment info, thread info)
      .. <gasnet_help.h> Extended and core API platform independant helpers.

* config-aux: helper scripts for configure

* {conduitname}-conduit: the complete implementation for a particular GASNet conduit. 
This directory is in charge of providing/installing the headers listed above,
compiling any appropriate tests and building/installing the following libraries:

 libgasnet-conduitname-seq.a - GASNET_SEQ implementation of GASNet
 libgasnet-conduitname-par.a - GASNET_PAR implementation of GASNet
 libgasnet-conduitname-parsync.a - GASNET_PARSYNC implementation of GASNet

* template-conduit: A conduit template which can be used as a starting point for new
conduit implementations. 

* other: A container directory for any external supporting libraries or
utilities used by one or more conduits.

* extended-ref: the reference implementation of the GASNet extended API. Conduits
can optionally use some or all of the files in this directory by compiling the
sources into the conduit library and installing the headers into the appropriate
conduit include directory. See mpi-conduit for an example of how to use the
reference extended API implementation.

* tests: basic tests written to the GASNet API that should run on any GASNet
conduit. These can be sucked in and compiled in each conduit directory (see
mpi-conduit for an example).

* docs: documentation on GASNet and various conduits

  Please do not make any conduit-specific changes to the files in the
extended-ref or tests directories.  They do not have any Makefiles because they
just provide a centralized place for files used in other directories.
