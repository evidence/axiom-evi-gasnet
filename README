README file for GASNet
by: Dan Bonachea <bonachea@cs.berkeley.edu>

This is a combination user manual and design document for GASNet. Anyone
planning on using, modifying or adding to the GASNet code base should read this
file. For GASNet licensing and usage terms, see license.txt.

Building and Installing GASNet
==============================
Here are the steps to build GASNet:

* ./Bootstrap  
  Runs the autoconf tools to build a configure script (this can be done on any
system and may already have been done for you)

* ./configure (options)
  Generate the Makefiles tailored to your system, creating a build tree in the
current working directory.  You can run configure from a different directory to
place your build files somewhere other than inside the source tree (a nice
option when maintaining several build trees on the same source tree). 

  Some of the useful configure options:

    --help - display all available configure options
    --prefix=/install/path - set the directory where GASNet will be installed
    --enable-debug - build GASNet in a debugging mode. This turns on C-level
      debugger options and also enables extensive error checking in the MPI 
      conduit (and others), which is useful for debugging GASNet clients 
      (but should not be used for performance testing). 
    --enable-trace - turn on GASNet tracing (see usage info below)
    --enable-stats - turn on GASNet statistical collection (see usage info below)
    --enable-segment-{fast,large,everything} - select a GASNet segment 
      configuration (see the GASNet spec for more info)
    --{enable,disable}-smp-safe - Build GASNet for an SMP or uni-processor.
      These options are not normally necessary, since by default configure
      will probe the machine to determine if it is an SMP.  However:
      1) If you configure on a uni-processor and intend to use the resulting
         libraries on an SMP, then you MUST specify --enable-smp-safe to
         ensure correctness.
      2) If you configure on an SMP for execution ONLY on uniprocessors, then
         you MAY specify --disable-smp-safe for a performance improvement.
      Currently only the Intel (IA32 and IA64) platforms use these options.

  Configure will detect various interesting features about your system and
compilers, including which GASNet conduits are supported.

* gmake all
  Build the GASNet libraries. A number of other useful makefile targets 
  are available from the top-level:
    gmake tests-{seq,par,parsync}  
      build all the GASNet tests in a given mode
    gmake run-tests-{seq,par,parsync}  
      build and run all the GASNet tests in a given mode
    gmake run-tests
      run whatever tests are already built in the conduit directories
  Each conduit also has several useful makefile targets:
    gmake tests-{seq,par,parsync}  
      build the conduit tests in a given mode
    gmake testXXX 
      build just testXXX, in SEQ mode
    gmake testXXX-{seq,par,parsync}
      build just testXXX, in a given mode
    gmake run-tests-{seq,par,parsync}  
      build and run the conduit tests in a given mode
    gmake run-tests
      run whatever tests are already built in the conduit directories

* gmake install
  Install GASNet to the directory chosen at configure time. This will create an
include directory with a sub-directory for each supported conduit, and a lib
directory containing a library file for each supported conduit, as well as any
supporting libraries.

Basic Usage Information
=================
See the README for each GASNet core implementations for specific usage
information, but generally client programs should #include <gasnet.h>
(and nothing else), and use the conduit-provided compilation settings.

The best way to get the correct compiler flags for your GASNet client is to 
"include" the appropriate makefile fragment for the conduit and configuration 
you want in your Makefile, and use the variables it defines in the Makefile 
rules for your GASNet client code.

For example:
  ----------------------------
  include /install/path/include/mpi-conduit/mpi-seq.mak 

  .c.o:
	  $(GASNET_CC) $(GASNET_CFLAGS) -c -o $@ $<

  myprog: myprog.o
	  $(GASNET_LD) $(GASNET_LDFLAGS) -o $@ $< $(GASNET_LIBS)
  ----------------------------

See tests/Makefile for another example of compiling GASNet client code.

# = No working MPI implementation available, although we have every reason to
believe mpi conduit would work if one was available.

Other combinations of the platforms above are likely to also work, these are
just the systems we've personally tested. Several of the systems listed using a
vendor-specific C compiler can also use gcc as the underlying C compiler,
although we generally recommend the vendor C compiler for performance reasons.

Recognized Environment Variables
================================

* GASNET_FREEZE - set to make GASNet pause and wait for a debugger to attach on
 startup

* GASNET_TRACEFILE, GASNET_TRACEMASK, GASNET_STATSFILE, GASNET_STATSMASK - 
 control tracing & statistical features, if enabled at configure time. 
 See usage information below.

* see conduit-specific documentation in conduit directories for more settings

GASNet tracing & statistical collection
=======================================

GASNet includes an extensive tracing and statistical collection 
utility for monitoring communication events in GASNet applications.
To use, configure with --enable-stats and/or --enable-trace, and
run your program as usual. In order to see the trace/stats output, 
you must set the environment variable GASNET_TRACEFILE and/or 
GASNET_STATSFILE as explained below.

Note that system performance is likely to be degraded as a result of tracing and 
statistical collection. This is still true even when output is disabled
by not setting this GASNET_TRACEFILE/GASNET_STATSFILE (so production platforms 
should not enable tracing/stats at GASNet configure time).

Optional environment variable settings:

 GASNET_TRACEFILE - specify a file name to recieve the trace output
   may also be "stdout" or "stderr", (or "-" to indicate stderr)
   each node may have its output directed to a separate file, 
   and any '%' character in the value is replaced by the node number at runtime
   (e.g. GASNET_TRACEFILE="mytrace-%")
   unsetting this environment variable (or setting it to empty) disables 
   tracing output (although the trace code still has performance impact)

 GASNET_STATSFILE - specify a filename to recieve statistical output
   operates analogously to GASNET_TRACEFILE

 GASNET_TRACEMASK - specify the types of trace messages to report
   A string containing one or more of the following letters:
     G - gets
     P - puts
     S - non-blocking synchronization
     W - collective operations (excluding barriers)
     X - collective synchronization (excluding barriers)
     B - barriers
     L - locks
     A - AM requests/replies (and handler execution, if conduit-supported)
     I - informational messages about system status or performance alerts
     C - conduit-specific (low-level) messages
     D - Detailed message data for gets/puts/AMreqrep
     N - Line number information from client source files
     H - High-level messages from the client
  default: (all of the above)

 GASNET_STATSMASK - specify the types of statistics to collect and report
   operates analogously to GASNET_TRACEMASK


GASNet Design Information
=========================

See the GASNet specification for information about the GASNet API. A copy is
included with this archive in docs/, and the definitive version is located on
the GASNet webpage here:

  http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bonachea/gasnet

The GASNet API is a two-level interface consisting of the lower-level "core API"
and the upper-level "extended API". All of the functions in the extended API can
be implemented using the core API, but some implementations may choose to
implement them directly for performance reasons. We use the term "conduit" to
refer to any complete implementation of the GASNet API (both layers), which
targets a specific network device or lower-level networking layer. A conduit
is comprised of any required headers, source files and supporting libraries
necessary to provide the functionality of the GASNet API to GASNet clients. Some
conduits may be monolithic - implementing the entire GASNet API directly on the
lower-level network system, and others may be layered - directly implementing
just the GASNet core API and borrowing a reference implementation of the
extended API which is written using the core primitives.

This distribution provides several conduits for different networks that are
packaged together for convenience because they share some code and general
infrastructure. However, each conduit is logically a stand-alone implementation
of the GASNet API. Note there may eventually be other GASNet conduits (e.g.
provided by vendors) which need not be included as part of this distribution -
all that's required of a conduit is that it implements the standardized GASNet API.

System Organization
===================

The directory tree for this distribution looks something like this:

top-level/
 \__ config-aux/
 \__ tests/
 \__ docs/
 \__ extended-ref/
 \__ {conduitname1}-conduit/
 \__ {conduitname2}-conduit/
 \__ template-conduit/
 \__ other/

* top-level: contains the GASNet configuration scripts and master Makefile and
GASNet headers.

  When making changes to GASNet (esp the configure script), please remember that
GASNet is not only a communication system for UPC, but also a self-contained
product used as the communication system for other languages (like Titanium) so
the configuration scripts, header files, etc. should not rely on anything from
outside directories not included in this distribution (other than basic system
headers and lower-level networking libraries).

* Header files: The GASNet master header file (gasnet.h) #includes
several files which should be provided by each conduit:

<gasnet.h> includes the following files:
   <gasnet_config.h> Created by the configure script, this header helps in
		     customizing gasnet for site-specific and platform-specific
		     information.
   <gasnet_basic.h>  Defines various basic and optimizing compiler macros,
                     platform-independent integer types and c++ binding macros.
   <gasnet_help.h> Extended and core API platform independant helpers
                    (providing services which aren't part of GASNet API, but are
		     required by code in gasnet.h)
   <gasnet_trace.h> Implements GASNet's sophisticated
                    internal tracing and statistical collection system
   <gasnet_core_fwd.h> definitions of basic constants and types used by the
		       core API and included early in the gasnet.h file
		       (gasnet.h provides some default values for various
		       constants and types that can be overridden here)
   <gasnet_extended_fwd.h>  Allows a specific extended implementation to
			    override the default gasnet types such as handles
			    and threadinfo.
   <gasnet_core.h> Provides the public interface for the GASNet core API
		   (function prototypes and/or inline functions for
		   implementing the core API).
      .. <gasnet_core_help.h> This is the core's entry point to provide access
			      to private symbols which might be required by the 
			      core header (eg: node's node id, number of nodes
			      in job), but which should not really be publicly
			      visible to client code (i.e. not part of GASNet API)
   <gasnet_extended.h> Provides the public interface for the GASNet extended API
      .. <gasnet_extended_help.h> Extended API's entry point to define private symbols
				  used by the extended header (e.g.segment info, 
				  thread info) but which should not really be publicly
			          visible to client code (i.e. not part of GASNet API)

Many conduits also have <gasnet_core_internal.h> and <gasnet_extended_internal.h> files
which are _not_ included by gasnet.h (and therefore not visible to client code) and
are exclusively for use in building the conduit libraries. 
<gasnet_internal.h> is the conduit-independent version of these files at the top level.

* config-aux: helper scripts for configure

* {conduitname}-conduit: the complete implementation for a particular GASNet conduit. 
This directory is in charge of providing/installing the headers listed above,
compiling any appropriate tests and building/installing the following libraries:

 libgasnet-conduitname-seq.a - GASNET_SEQ implementation of GASNet
 libgasnet-conduitname-par.a - GASNET_PAR implementation of GASNet
 libgasnet-conduitname-parsync.a - GASNET_PARSYNC implementation of GASNet

* template-conduit: A conduit template which should be used as a starting point for 
new conduit implementations. See the README.template file in this directory for detailed 
instructions.

* other: A container directory for any external supporting libraries or
utilities used by one or more conduits.

* extended-ref: the reference implementation of the GASNet extended API. Conduits
can optionally use some or all of the files in this directory by compiling the
sources into the conduit library and installing the headers into the appropriate
conduit include directory. See mpi-conduit for an example of how to use the
reference extended API implementation (the template-conduit is setup to use the
extended-ref implementation by default).

* tests: basic tests written to the GASNet API that should run on any GASNet
conduit. These can be sucked in and compiled in each conduit directory (see
mpi-conduit for an example).

* docs: documentation on GASNet and various conduits

  Please do not make any conduit-specific changes to the files in the
extended-ref or tests directories.  They do not have any Makefiles because they
just provide a centralized place for files used in other directories.

  When implementing the extended API for your conduit, please clone only the
necessary files from the extended-ref directory that you need to change 
(and continue to include the unchanged files) to reduce maintenance headache
(this applies especially to gasnet_extended.h).
