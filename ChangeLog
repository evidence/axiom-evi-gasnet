GASNet ChangeLog
----------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------
11-10-2003 : Release 1.3

* Added Infiniband support in vapi-conduit - currently only SEGMENT_FAST is supported

* elan-conduit: 
  - updated for the most recent version of libelan
  - fix a few race conditions

* gm-conduit:
  - updated for GM 2.0, including RDMA get support
  - Added 64-bit support
  - Reworked the spawner to work with mpiexec, gexec, MPICH mpirun and a custom spawner

* lapi-conduit:
  - Fix bugs related to varying LAPI uhdr payload size across systems - this is
    now queried automatically at runtime

* Add a logGP test program for GASNet conduits

* Add a threaded tester for gasnet threaded clients

* Added a GASNet/MPI test that tests the compatibility of a GASNet conduit with
  MPI calls made by the GASNet client. 

* All GASNet conduits other than gm are now fully compatible with limited MPI
  calls from the GASNet client code. In order to prevent deadlock and ensure
  safety, GASNet and MPI communication should be separated by barriers.

* Factor the firehose page registration system into a new, separate firehose
  library with a public interface, for use by gm-conduit and vapi-conduit
 
* Use "adaptive" pthreads mutexes on Linux (when available), for better SMP performance

* Added support for new platforms: Solaris-SPARC 64-bit 
  and new compilers:  Portland Group C, SunPro C and Intel C

* Add SIGCONT as an additional option for unfreezing a GASNet application
  This is a useful option for debugging GASNet apps which lack debugging symbols
  (but may still have enough info to give you a stack trace, etc) A GASNet app
  frozen by GASNET_FREEZE can now be unfrozen by sending: "kill -CONT pid"
  to each process, or on some systems by typing control-Z on the console to
  suspend the process and then fg to resume it (sends a SIGCONT for you).

* HSL calls now compile away to nothing when HSL's are unnecessary 

* Merged AMMPI v0.8, includes fixes to rare buffer overflows and small memory leaks

* fixed pthread barrier errors caused by a race condition

* Minor semantic change to no-interrupt sections -
  gasnet_{hold,resume}_interrupts() are now officially ignored within a GASNet
  handler context (where interrupts are already suspended anyhow). 

* add new function gasnet_set_waitmode() to control waiting behavior

* Use an atexit handler to make sure we finalize the trace/stats file, even 
  if the client exits without calling gasnet_exit

* Fixes to gasneti_local_membar(), especially for SMP/UNI Linux kernels and PowerPC

* New significant GASNet conduit programming practices:
  gasneti_{malloc,calloc,free}, gasneti_assert, GASNETI_CLIENT_THREADS,
  GASNETI_CONDUIT_THREADS, (N)DEBUG -> GASNET_(N)DEBUG, STATS,TRACE ->
  GASNET_{STATS,TRACE}

* Many minor fixes

----------------------------------------------------------------------
06-28-2003 : Release 1.2

* Greatly increased the number of platforms supported - notably, this release
  adds support for FreeBSD, IRIX, HPUX, Solaris, MSWindows-Cygwin and Mac OSX,
  as well as the SunPro, MIPSPro, Portland Group and Intel C compilers. See the
  top-level README for the complete list of supported platforms.

* Added the smp-conduit, which implements pure loopback to support GASNet
  clients on platforms lacking a network.

* Remove 256-node scalability limit - mpi, elan and lapi conduits now
  theoretically scale to 2^31 nodes. gm conduit scales to 2^16 nodes.

* Merge v0.7 of AMMPI - improved latency performance, better scalability, and
  fixes for LAM/MPI

* Fix bug 120 - gasnet_exit now reliably kills the entire job on all conduits
  in various collective and non-collective invocation situations.

* New switches GASNETE_PUTGET_ALWAYSLOCAL and GASNETE_PUTGET_ALWAYSREMOTE which
  optimize away the locality check for put/gets implemented by
  gasnete_islocal() 

* Updates to the tracing system - separate statistics from tracing to allow
  finer user control controlled by new environment variables - GASNET_STATSMASK
  and GASNET_STATSFILE

* Major cleanup to the gm-conduit bootstrap code

* Internal structural changes to gasnet_extended.h to provide more flexibility
  for conduit overrides

* Minor wording clarifications to the GASNet spec

* Many minor bug fixes

----------------------------------------------------------------------
04-17-2003 : Release 1.1

* Added lots of conduit user and design documentation
* Fix bugs with gasnet_register_value_t functionality, in some cases garbage 
  was returned by gasnet_get_val() in the upper bytes
* Fix bug 51 - endianness bugs on gasnet_*_val()
* Tweak the gcc optimizer settings to ensure that we get full inlining
* Ensure gasnet_exit() or fatal signals always correctly shut down the global 
  job (mpi and elan conduits - gm and lapi still have known problems)
* Add strong configure warnings about using gcc 2.96 - users are highly 
  recommended to avoid this broken compiler
* Ensure configure caching is always on
* Basic infrastructure cleanups to the conduit Makefile fragments
* Fix a shutdown-time crash when tracing
* Add GASNET_CONFIG_STRING to spec & implementation and embed it in library
* Add a number of minor clarifications to the GASNet spec
* Clean up licensing issues

* elan-conduit: 
 - fixups for better handling of elan memory exhaustion
 - preallocate AMLong bounce buffers

* gm-conduit:
 - various stability fixes
 - add spawning scripts for gexec and pbs

* mpi-conduit:
 - add global environment variable exchange to ensure consistent
   gasnet_getenv() results across nodes
 - merge AMMPI release 0.6
