GASNet ChangeLog
----------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------
06-28-2003 : Release 1.2

* Greatly increased the number of platforms supported - notably, this release
  adds support for FreeBSD, IRIX, HPUX, Solaris, MSWindows-Cygwin and Mac OSX,
  as well as the SunPro, MIPSPro, Portland Group and Intel C compilers. See the
  top-level README for the complete list of supported platforms.

* Added the smp-conduit, which implements pure loopback to support GASNet
  clients on platforms lacking a network.

* Remove 256-node scalability limit - mpi, elan and lapi conduits now
  theoretically scale to 2^31 nodes. gm conduit scales to 2^16 nodes.

* Merge v0.7 of AMMPI - improved latency performance, better scalability, and
  fixes for LAM/MPI

* Fix bug 120 - gasnet_exit now reliably kills the entire job on all conduits
  in various collective and non-collective invocation situations.

* New switches GASNETE_PUTGET_ALWAYSLOCAL and GASNETE_PUTGET_ALWAYSREMOTE which
  optimize away the locality check for put/gets implemented by
  gasnete_islocal() 

* Updates to the tracing system - separate statistics from tracing to allow
  finer user control controlled by new environment variables - GASNET_STATSMASK
  and GASNET_STATSFILE

* Major cleanup to the gm-conduit bootstrap code

* Internal structural changes to gasnet_extended.h to provide more flexibility
  for conduit overrides

* Minor wording clarifications to the GASNet spec

* Many minor bug fixes

----------------------------------------------------------------------
04-17-2003 : Release 1.1

* Added lots of conduit user and design documentation
* Fix bugs with gasnet_register_value_t functionality, in some cases garbage 
  was returned by gasnet_get_val() in the upper bytes
* Fix bug 51 - endianness bugs on gasnet_*_val()
* Tweak the gcc optimizer settings to ensure that we get full inlining
* Ensure gasnet_exit() or fatal signals always correctly shut down the global 
  job (mpi and elan conduits - gm and lapi still have known problems)
* Add strong configure warnings about using gcc 2.96 - users are highly 
  recommended to avoid this broken compiler
* Ensure configure caching is always on
* Basic infrastructure cleanups to the conduit Makefile fragments
* Fix a shutdown-time crash when tracing
* Add GASNET_CONFIG_STRING to spec & implementation and embed it in library
* Add a number of minor clarifications to the GASNet spec
* Clean up licensing issues

* elan-conduit: 
 - fixups for better handling of elan memory exhaustion
 - preallocate AMLong bounce buffers

* gm-conduit:
 - various stability fixes
 - add spawning scripts for gexec and pbs

* mpi-conduit:
 - add global environment variable exchange to ensure consistent
   gasnet_getenv() results across nodes
 - merge AMMPI release 0.6
